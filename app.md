### 3. **Asking Questions**

After uploading a file and providing your API key, you can begin querying the document. Here's how:

- **Step 1**: In the **chat input** box at the bottom of the screen, type your question. This could be any question related to the content of the PDF you uploaded.


- **Step 2**: Press **Enter** or click **Submit** to send your question.

- **Step 3**: The system will analyze the content of the PDF using a vector-based search and answer your question based on the most relevant sections of the document.

### 4. **Viewing Responses**

Once you submit a question, the system generates a response based on the content of the uploaded PDF.

- **Step 1**: The **user's question** will appear in the chat as a message labeled under "user."
- **Step 2**: After a brief wait (shown as a spinner), the system will display an **assistantâ€™s response** below your query.

- **Step 3**: If the context used for generating the response is available, it will also be displayed in the **sidebar** under the "Context" section. You can review the specific text snippets the system used to answer your question.

### Key Features

- **Multiple Questions**: You can ask several questions related to the PDF, and the system will keep track of the conversation history to provide context-aware responses.
  
- **Contextual Information**: For each answer, the system displays the relevant portions of the PDF file used to generate the response, providing transparency in the answer generation.
